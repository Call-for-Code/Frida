# Roadmap

Frida mobile application contains an end-to-end solution that integrates with the IBM IoT platform and IBM Watson Studio. 
Our future roadmap adds more functionality to Frida, including applying a visual recognition model to show damaged buildings 
and finding trapped victims, showing escape routes on a map through AI functions, using a Jupyter notebook to predict earthquake magnitude, and applying a blockchain for fundraising transparency in a web application. For this solution, we are focusing on earthquakes and schools, however, our kit can definitely be expanded to handle other types of natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, floods, landslides, hurricanes, and tornados. The IoT device can be manufactured in large scale and deployed into institutions.
