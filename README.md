# Frida, AI and IoT comes to the aid of teachers, students, and first responders

Frida is an an end-to-end solution with a mobile AI-enabled application called Frida, and an IoT device called fridaSOS, which can be installed in schools and universities. The solution uses built-in AI functions to provide earthquake preparation, guide people through drills, predict the magnitude of earthquakes based on sensor data, identify the best escape routes during earthquakes, and detect people trapped in damaged classrooms. It is a first-of-a-kind complete solution for providing data collection, monitoring, notifications, and guidance before, during, and after a disaster.
Code and documentation is in the process of being transferred. Watch this repository for updates on progress.
